excerpt: "Finally releasing the first video in my series of video tutorials! The Internet has made showcasing your work on your own website a smart move for your career no matter what field you’re in, so in this video I show you how to make a professional online portfolio using Tumblr.com and why I think it could be the perfect platform for beginners who don't want to get their hands dirty with more advanced hosting and development tools!

<p><first-letter>F</first-letter>inally releasing the first video in my series of video tutorials! The Internet has made showcasing your work on your own website a smart move for your career no matter what field you’re in, so in this video I show you how to make a professional online portfolio using <a href="https://tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr.com</a> and why I think it could be the perfect platform for beginners who don't want to get their hands dirty with more advanced hosting and development tools! I go over how to upload content to<em> Tumblr</em>, the three ways you can install themes, and briefly show you the theme customizer. In the video I also briefly show you how to change the settings of your blog to make it more professional such as enabling messages, hiding the posts you like and the people you follow, and connecting a custom domain.</p>
 
<p>I also show you a lot of great resources in this video to create a nice portfolio site such as the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/themes/" target="_blank">Tumblr Theme Store</a> and the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/themes/tagged/free" target="_blank">free section</a> of it, the awesome <a href="http://theme-hunter.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Theme-Hunter</a> blog that showcases hundreds of free themes from the <em>Tumblr</em> community, and the two themes I used in the video: <a href="http://void-theme.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">The Void</a> by <a href="https://themecloset.com/" target="_blank">themecloset-themes</a> and <a href="https://yeolithm-34.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Theme 34</a> by <a href="https://yeoli-thm.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">yeoli-thm</a>.</p>

<p>Also, to make this video, I used <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">Screencast-O-Matic</a> to record my screen and microphone as I did the demonstration, and I used <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/powerpoint" target="_blank">Microsoft PowerPoint 2016</a> (which you can get for free if you're a student <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education" target="_blank">here</a>) to make the slides for the transitions between sections of the video. The Creative Commons images I used for the portfolio site in the video can be found <a href="https://creative-commons-best-images.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please leave a comment under my video if you think I can improve anything to make videos like these more pleasant to listen to or watch. Also tell me if you have any suggestions on what content I can make next, as I am always open to suggestions.</p>
