excerpt: "This is the final post that's going on this blog for a while! Here I give a super brief summary of the events in my life to-date in late 2019."

<p>So, folks, I've been delaying the inevitable. This blog is <strong>cancelled</strong>. Here's why:</p>

<p>I graduated in May and actually got a full-time job in late July of this year! With my other projects, I simply don't have any time to maintain a blog (and no real reason to). I honestly didn't enjoy having to come up with written content on a weekly basis, and this blog's topics were just way too scattered and honestly not that interesting for me to write about. Henceforth this site shall be in an archived state indefinitely and will mainly just be used as a record of my web design and development skills at the time I made it.</p>

<p>That is all! Happy holidays and see you later!</p>
