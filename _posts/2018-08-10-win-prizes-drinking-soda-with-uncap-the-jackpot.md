excerpt: "A few weeks ago I decided to flip over the cap of a Jarritos brand soda to look for a number, because I vaguely remembered that companies sometimes did raffles and such to reward loyal customers and provide an incentive to buy their products. To my surprise, I found a short code and a website address! This first cap won me $25 in the form of a check, and it was really as simple as buying a soda and entering the code on the site. I probably just got really lucky because I haven't won another cash prize since then, but I wrote this so you can try your luck, too!"

<h3>Winning Without Purchasing?</h3>

<p>Something I discovered while reading the terms is that there is a way to win without even purchasing a beverage. UndertheCapAMOE.com is where you can get two codes per email per day that you can redeem on WinPrizes.net. You have to answer a few questions about how you enjoy your Novamex beverage, so <strong>answer truthfully</strong> and <strong>don't use more than one email</strong>! Also, make sure to <strong>save your confirmation email and the email containing your winning AMOE code</strong>!</p>

<p>Good luck playing and enjoy your drink!</p>
