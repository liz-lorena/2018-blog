<p><first-letter>T</first-letter>his is the theme page of this place's current theme where I will document the most recent changes to it. I have also provided the alterations I have made to the theme's CSS code on Github.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://github.com/lizberberena/personal-savona-child-theme" target="_blank">Source Code</a></p>

<p>The WordPress theme I chose was <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/savona/" target="_blank">Savona</a> by <a href="https://optimathemes.com/" target="_blank">Optima Themes</a>. Here is the preview image of the original theme I worked with:</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/savonaoriginal.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

<p>I decided to combine my website into both a blog and portfolio. The home page is a static page with a gallery of my best projects. I've always wanted to make this cool modern gallery-type thing. Here's the home page as of <strong>November 22, 2018</strong>:</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/cssbylizorg.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

<p>Mousing over an image shows the name of the project in a stylized tooltip. Clicking the image will either take you to a blog post about the project or the project itself if I haven't yet made a blog post about it.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/blog.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

<p>I moved my blog posts from the home page to its own separate blog page. I changed the style of the display of the posts to a gallery as well, and I love the look of it.</p>

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/cssbylizorg2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>

<p>Something I'm really proud of on this page is the way I made the information about the post display. When you mouse over an image, the image will decrease in opacity and display the category, title, and post date over the image. Then the post excerpt will appear under the post image, and the post images around the excerpt will move out of the way to make room for the excerpt. The effect looks super clean and modern.</p>

<p>In the near future, I hope to make a theme from scratch for my blog, but I will continue to add to this child theme and hopefully change it enough to the point where I can release it on the WordPress theme directory!</p>
